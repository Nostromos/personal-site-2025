        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="http://what.lol/blog/2024/02/24/what-im-looking-for#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>After spending 10+ years hiring engineers and the last 2 years learning to code, I'm looking for an opportunity to join an engineering team.</p>
<p>I started coding with Visual Basic in elementary school, quickly moved on to Flash and Actionscript, and for much of my tech recruiting career, would noodle with Python and JS when I could but was mostly building tools for recruiters to use with Excel/Google Sheets scripting (think Offer Generators, Offer Comparison tools, Market Analysis sheets, etc.).</p>

<p>My main focus right now is shipping things. I don't care if that's bug fixes, UI tweaks, or docs. Stick me in a closet as long as I get the chance to work on a real codebase and ship.</p>
<p>If I had my way, my new workplace would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative</li>
<li>Low Bureacratic Overhead</li>
<li>Innovative</li>
<li>Growing</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm trying to learn the craft and a place where I'd have access to patient mentorship would be great.</p>
<p>My main goal is growth and ideally, I'm working autonomously (to whatever degree possible) within a year. By that I mean I don't take up someone elses time to get things done.</p>

<p>My education is mostly fullstack and that's where I thrive.</p>

<p>I've got a lot of experience with Typescript and <em>some</em> experience with Golang so I think I'd thrive in this space, though ramping up may take more time. My end goal is backend engineering.</p>

<p><strong>In-office</strong> is ideal for me. I much prefer the structure that it provides to my day. Right now, I'm paying for a desk at WeWork to ensure I have a place to go and focus on getting things done.</p>
<p>I'm open to <strong>Flexible</strong> or <strong>Hybrid</strong> situations <em>X days per week in office</em> but I'll try to come in as often as I'm allowed.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="work-hours">Work Hours<a href="http://what.lol/blog/2024/02/24/what-im-looking-for#work-hours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Work Hours" title="Direct link to Work Hours">​</a></h3>
<p>7-10 hours is where I typically max out, depending on how that times breaks down. In my past career, 7 hours of candidate calls was the limit before I lost my ability to be a helpful and enthusiastic recruiter.</p>
<p>On the dev side, I find that I can go up to 10 hours with breaks for lunch and gym.</p>
<p>The biggest things I'd hope to see are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible hours - I prefer to work out in the middle of the day to avoid afternoon tiredness. I also need to drop my kid at daycare and pick her up 2-3 days a week (my wife and I switch).</li>
<li>Marathon Culture - I've seen teams that work insane hours and they're rarely happy or shipping anything good. If the equity is right, I will give you my whole life, but if its not, I'd hope to see that others have a healthy work-life balance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Health Insurance and decent PTO policies are my only must-haves but nice things would be fitness reimbursement, lunch, etc.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What I loved about tech recruiting was using my people skills to impact company success. There was nothing more satisfying than hiring someone amazing and watching them create something great. It was rewarding to see my work translate to business success, but also to see a team excited about a new hire.</p>
<p>What I loved about tech recruiting was seeing my people skills translate directly to success in the business. There was nothing more satisfying than hiring someone who excites a team and helps them do something big.</p>
<p>After 10 years, that lost some of its emotional valence and I found myself increasingly… jealous. I’d always coded throughout life - visual basic and actionscript as a kid. Python, JS, excel/google sheets, SQL as a recruiter and manager, building dashboards to monitor team performance and tools to help me scrape profiles or refine search results only attainable through an API.</p>
<p>Eventually, seeing a large part of the tech recruiting org (~150 people) use and enjoy a tool I built gave me more satisfaction than a bonus for beating hiring goals.</p>
<p>I was also burnt out - recruiting is fairly rote. Every day you do your searches, hit your outreach targets, take calls, and ensure that decisions are being made and candidates are moving up or out. There isn't too much room for creativity and the recipe for success is fairly similar at most companies. Management provided an interesting change and a more strategic view but I was already considering a change.</p>
<p>So, I took some time to reflect and travel and decided to commit to the transition.</p>

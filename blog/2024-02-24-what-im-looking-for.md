## Introduction

After spending 10+ years hiring engineers and the last 2 years learning to code, I'm looking for an opportunity to join an engineering team.

<!-- truncate -->

I started coding with Visual Basic in elementary school, quickly moved on to Flash and Actionscript, and for much of my tech recruiting career, would noodle with Python and JS when I could but was mostly building tools for recruiters to use with Excel/Google Sheets scripting (think Offer Generators, Offer Comparison tools, Market Analysis sheets, etc.).

## Core Principles and Values

My main focus right now is shipping things. I don't care if that's bug fixes, UI tweaks, docs, features, or services. I want a real codebase and a stake in its success. I want to write clean and performant code that solves problems for the business and meets requirements. 

If I had my way, my new workplace would be:
- Collaborative
- Low Bureacratic Overhead
- Innovative
- Growing

I want to learn and see how others do things. Ideally, I don't have to spend most of my time in meetings. When I was in Recruiting, I was lucky to get 1-2 hours a day to put my head down and do deeper work. I want to work with modern technology and ideally the company or product is finding success. 

## Roles & Challenges I'm Targeting

### Roles

#### Full Stack

Full stack web might be the sweet spot. I enjoy it and I've gotten good at it (compared to other bootcamp or new grads). At least for my portfolio projects, 

#### Frontend

Frontend greatly interests me and I have (sometimes strong) opinions about UI, UX, and information design. I *enjoy* design but I wouldn't call myself a designer. I've hired and seen what truly great designers can do and I don't think I'm strong in that way. I **am** good at taking Designs and creating them in code, pixel-perfect and responsive.

#### Backend

I've got a lot of experience with Typescript and *some* experience with Golang so I think I'd thrive in this space, though ramping up may take more time. Some of my most interesting projects were entirely backend focused - building a load balancer, my dinky little compiler, building a log monitoring system.

## Skills & Accomplishments

## What I Want In My Next Team

**Support** is the main thing. I'm new to the role and I'm not a fresh-faced college kid. I'm smart and I work hard but I don't know what I don't know. 

Beyond that, I'm adaptable.

## Ideal Work Conditions

### Remote vs On-Site

**In-office** is ideal for me. I much prefer the structure that it provides to my day. Right now, I'm paying for a desk at WeWork to ensure I have a place to go and focus on getting things done.

I'm open to **Flexible** or **Hybrid** situations *X days per week in office* but I'll try to come in as often as I'm allowed. 

### Work Hours

7-10 hours is where I typically max out, but I've done more for spurts of a few weeks to a few months.

I also hope to see flexibility on hours - I typically start my day around 7am and go the gym over lunch. I would hope to continue this in my next role. 


### Benefits

I'm less motivated by benefits beyond insurance and PTO but would *love* to see 401k matching or child care benefits.

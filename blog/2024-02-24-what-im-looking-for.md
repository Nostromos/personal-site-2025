## Introduction

After spending 10+ years hiring engineers and the last 2 years learning to code, I'm looking for an opportunity to join an engineering team.

<!-- truncate -->

I started coding with Visual Basic in elementary school, quickly moved on to Flash and Actionscript, and for much of my tech recruiting career, would noodle with Python and JS when I could but was mostly building tools for recruiters to use with Excel/Google Sheets scripting (think Offer Generators, Offer Comparison tools, Market Analysis sheets, etc.).

## Core Principles and Values

My main focus right now is shipping things. I don't care if that's bug fixes, UI tweaks, or docs. Stick me in a closet as long as I get the chance to work on a real codebase and ship.

If I had my way, my new workplace would be:
- Collaborative
- Low Bureacratic Overhead
- Innovative
- Growing

I'm trying to learn the craft and a place where I'd have access to patient mentorship would be great.

My main goal is growth and ideally, I'm working autonomously (to whatever degree possible) within a year. By that I mean I don't take up someone elses time to get things done. 

## Roles & Challenges I'm Targeting

### Roles

#### Full Stack

My education is mostly fullstack and that's where I thrive.

#### Frontend

TODO

#### Backend

I've got a lot of experience with Typescript and *some* experience with Golang so I think I'd thrive in this space, though ramping up may take more time. My end goal is backend engineering.

## Ideal Work Conditions

### Remote vs On-Site

**In-office** is ideal for me. I much prefer the structure that it provides to my day. Right now, I'm paying for a desk at WeWork to ensure I have a place to go and focus on getting things done.

I'm open to **Flexible** or **Hybrid** situations *X days per week in office* but I'll try to come in as often as I'm allowed. 

### Work Hours

7-10 hours is where I typically max out, depending on how that times breaks down. In my past career, 7 hours of candidate calls was the limit before I lost my ability to be a helpful and enthusiastic recruiter. 

On the dev side, I find that I can go up to 10 hours with breaks for lunch and gym. 

The biggest things I'd hope to see are:
- Flexible hours - I prefer to work out in the middle of the day to avoid afternoon tiredness. I also need to drop my kid at daycare and pick her up 2-3 days a week (my wife and I switch).
- Marathon Culture - I've seen teams that work insane hours and they're rarely happy or shipping anything good. If the equity is right, I will give you my whole life, but if its not, I'd hope to see that others have a healthy work-life balance. 

### Benefits

Health Insurance and decent PTO policies are my only must-haves but nice things would be fitness reimbursement, lunch, etc.

## How to get in touch

You can see all my contact info in my [Contact](@site/src/pages/contact/index.md) page. I prefer email the most.

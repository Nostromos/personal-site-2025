# Michael Monaghan

Hi, I'm Mike Monaghan, a former Technical Recruiter now Software Developer.

I work at `null`

I occasionally write [blog posts](../../blog/) about learning to code and working in tech.

Outside of programming, I most enjoy spending time with my family, travel, cooking, and diving into new hobbies.

I live in the Red Hook neighborhood of NYC, so if you're around [reach out](./contact/).

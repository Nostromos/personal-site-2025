# About Me

I’m a software developer with a background in technical recruiting and team building. After a decade of hiring and working alongside top engineering talent, I decided to step into the role myself— turning my long-standing interest in coding into a full-time career.

I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Golang, with most of my experience in web dev, specifically React. I enjoy working across the stack, but I’m especially drawn to backend and full-stack development. That said, I’m open to any role where I can contribute, grow, and ship great software.

## What sets me apart? 
A decade in the tech industry has given me a deep understanding of how great teams operate, how to communicate effectively across disciplines, and how to navigate complex technical and business challenges. My experience as a recruiter and hiring manager gives me a unique perspective on collaboration, problem-solving, and what it takes to build and scale products successfully.
